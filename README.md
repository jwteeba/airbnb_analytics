# 🏠 Berlin Airbnb Analytics Pipeline

**End-to-End Data Engineering Project | Snowflake • dbt • Dagster • Preset**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a modern, production-style data pipeline to ingest and analyze **Airbnb listing data from Berlin** in order to answer a fun but data-driven question:

> **Does a full moon actually influence customer ratings? 🌕**

The pipeline extracts raw listing data, loads it into **Snowflake**, transforms it using **dbt**, orchestrates workflows with **Dagster**, and delivers insights through an interactive dashboard built in **Preset (Apache Superset)**.
The entire project is version-controlled and deployed using **GitHub CI/CD** practices.
